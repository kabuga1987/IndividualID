## Code implementations accompanying the paper -- **Unique animal identification from images with neural networks**.
---
The paper develops a novel three-setep approach integrating segmentation, orientation, and similarity learning networks, and demonstrates the use of the approach on four species namely humpack whales, bottlenose dolphins, harbour seals, and western leopard toads.

1. The segmentation network is a [Mask RCNN model](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) adapted to our study-case datasets. This model is tasked with isolating and cropping animal objects conveying individual-specific characteristics.
2. The orientation network is a CNN-based model which decides which side of the animal was photographed. This plays a crucial role in individual identification since some key-distinctive features can only appear on one side. The folder [Orientation_models](https://github.com/kabuga1987/Individual_ID/tree/main/Orientation_models) contains the code for training and testing the orientation model as well as a subject of images for two species.

3. The similarity-learning network is either a triplet or a Siamese neural network that takes two images of the same orientation and decides whether they are from the same individual or two different individuals based on similarities. The folder [Similarity_learning_models](https://github.com/kabuga1987/Individual_ID/tree/main/Similarity_learning_models) has all the code for training and testing the simmilarity-learning models and a subset of images for each species.

All the required packages for running the models can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file.
