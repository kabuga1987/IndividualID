    "We used four different datasets (species) to validate our developed approach; therefore, we ran four separate models using the same architectures (each model per dataset). The script **Individual_ID_Siamese_NN_helper.py** contains all the required implementations to run the the similarity learning network based on the Siamese neural network. Here we provide four subsets of the datasets we used in the paper and csv files containing image names and their corresponding IDs where images having the same ID originate from the same individual, otherwise two different individuals. For e.g. p2 and p1 refer to the directory containing whale image examples and the csv file containing their IDs.\n",
